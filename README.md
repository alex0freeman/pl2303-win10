Windows 10 driver for end-of-life PL-2303 chipsets.

## About
Installs Prolific PL-2303 driver, version 3.3.11.152 (12-03-2010). The install program is a simple script which uses built-in Windows commands to add this driver to the internal DriverStore. 

## Usage
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/johnstevenson/pl2303-win10/releases) and unzip it somewhere on your computer.
* Open the main folder (prefixed `pl23030-win10-`) and double-click `install.bat`
* Allow Windows SmartScreen to run it.
* Follow the on-screen instructions.

Because this install program is just a script there is no need to keep it on your computer - so this folder can be deleted afterwards.
